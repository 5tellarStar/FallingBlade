Falling Blade is a fighting game highly based on First Cut by Drasnus https://drasnus.itch.io/first-cut

I made it for my "gymnasiearbete" foucusing on the CPUs (they aren't really fun to play against, but they work)

Contorls:
	Main menu:
	  Arrows to Move
	  Enter to Select
	  Backspace to Go back
	Player 1:
	  WASD to Move
	  U to Attack 
	  I to Dash
	Player 2:
	  Arrows to Move
	  Numpad 7 to Attack
	  Numpad 8 to Dash
	Enter to Continue to next round

Attacks can be charged
You win a round by knocking of the opponent of the platform
First to two rounds wins the game

The CPU level determines how likely the CPU is to do things each frame
Baby 1/200
Easy 1/100
Normal 1/50
Hard 1/10
Harder 1/1

Impossible is also 1/1, but it always saves one dash to save itself from falling. Theoretically possible to beat, but practicly impossible

Made with SFML
